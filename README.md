## Introduction
- EagleScout is an app developed by Team114 to collect and analyse scouting data.
- It has built in offline-mode, pit scouting (with storage for images), and picklist creation and management.
- Using the OpenAI API, it also is able to summarize large volumes of scouting comments quickly.
